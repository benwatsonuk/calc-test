The calculator can be seen in action at (http://benwatson.uk/work/calc/)

## To install and run

Clone the repository and run

That's it! Navigate to the stated port and try out some basic calculations.

### Notes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I wouldn't recommend using this calculator for anything important ðŸ˜‚
